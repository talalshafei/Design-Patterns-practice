## Conceptual Example

An excellent example of the Mediator pattern is a railway station traffic system. Two trains never communicate between themselves for the availability of the platform. The stationManager acts as a mediator and makes the platform available to only one of the arriving trains while keeping the rest in a queue. A departing train notifies the stations, which lets the next train in the queue to arrive.
