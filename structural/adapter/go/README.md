## Conceptual Example

We have a client code that expects some features of an object (Lightning port), but we have another object called adaptee (Windows laptop) which offers the same functionality but through a different interface (USB port)

This is where the Adapter pattern comes into the picture. We create a struct type known as adapter that will:

Adhere to the same interface which the client expects (Lightning port).

Translate the request from the client to the adaptee in the form that the adaptee expects. The adapter accepts a Lightning connector and then translates its signals into a USB format and passes them to the USB port in windows laptop.
