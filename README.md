Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) catalogs the 22 classic patterns, grouped into creational, structural, and behavioral categories. This repository contains examples of all these patterns implemented in both Golang and C++.
 
## Overview

This repository provides idiomatic Go and modern C++ implementations of all 22 classic design patterns. The patterns are divided into three categories:

- **Creational Patterns:** Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton.
- **Structural Patterns:** Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.  
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Chain of Responsibility, Command, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, Visitor.
