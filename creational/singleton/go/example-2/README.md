## Another Example

There are other methods of creating a singleton instance in Go:

1. `init` function
   We can create a single instance inside the `init` function. This is only applicable if the early initialization of the instance is ok. The `init` function is only called once per file in a package, so we can be sure that only a single instance will be created.

2. `sync.Once`
   The `sync.Once` will only perform the operation once.
